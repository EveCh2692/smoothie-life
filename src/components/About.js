            <p> Smoothie Life, the purpose of this application is to be able to share a few of my daily smoothie recipes, and inspire and encourage a  healthy lifestly. <br/>
             I am passionate about health, and understand that at times with the rush and busyness of life it may be difficult to eat healthily. At times it may <br/>
             be difficult to even get a meal in throughout the day. That is where a smoothie can come in handy. You can drink your daily dose of fruits or veggies <br/>
             in a cup and sometimes you can even drink it as a meal. In it, I have shared six delicious and nutritious smoothies along with the type of smoothie they <br/>
             are. This application also allows you to create a recipe of their own and save it with the rest of the smoothies in hope to inspire others to drink their <br/>
             daily dose of vitamins via a smoothie. I believe that a healthy lifestyle is essential to our physical and mental well-being, because what we put in our body <br/>
             also affects our brain/gut and how it functions. A simple change or addition as drinking a smoothie a day can shift the way you feel throughout the day.</p>
